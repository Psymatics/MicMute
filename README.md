# MicMute
 Mute & basic level control for microphone. Compatible with Windows Vista+.
 You can configure the audio device that should be controlled by the program, and you can even set it to a Playback device (if you really want to, it won't work the same).
 I recommend compiling with icon.ico as the default icon.
 
 Massive credit goes to whoever made VA.ahk, as they are what made it possible to turn this little dream of mine into a reality.
